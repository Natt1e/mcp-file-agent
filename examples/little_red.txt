Little Red Riding Hood

Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl who lived in a village. Everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood because she always wore a red hooded cloak given to her by her grandmother.

One day, her mother said, "Grandma is feeling sick. Take this basket of cakes and butter to her, but don’t talk to strangers on the way!"

Little Red Riding Hood promised and set off through the woods. Soon, she met a big, bad wolf.

"Where are you going, little girl?" asked the wolf slyly.
"To Grandma’s house," she replied innocently.

The wolf had a wicked plan. He ran ahead, knocked on Grandma’s door, and tricked her into letting him in. Then—gulp!—he swallowed Grandma whole! He put on her clothes and waited in bed.

When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange.

"Oh Grandma, what big ears you have!"
"All the better to hear you with!"

"What big eyes you have!"
"All the better to see you with!"

"What big teeth you have!"
"ALL THE BETTER TO EAT YOU WITH!" roared the wolf, jumping up!

Just then, a woodcutter heard the noise, rushed in, and saved Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma by cutting open the wolf’s belly. Grandma popped out, unharmed! They filled the wolf’s stomach with stones, and when he woke up, he ran away—never to return.

And from that day on, Little Red Riding Hood never spoke to strangers again.

The End.
